My name is Bovornpratch Vijarnwannaluk (nickname: Klod). I am a PhD. student at the astronomical institute Tohoku University in Japan. Origianlly, I am from Bangkok where I did my undergraduate at the department of physics Chulalongkorn University.

My research is focused on investigating the cosmological evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using large and deep X-ray datasets combined with deep optical and infrared imaging dataset. Of particluar interest is investigating the evolution of the fraction of the obscured AGN and the connection to the host galaxy properties. Recently, I am interested in studying the role of AGNs in galaxy evolution at moderate redshift using X-ray and radio datsets. Check out the research page for more details.

I am also involved with a few other collaborations. Mainly, I am part of the AGN working group in the <a href='https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/'>Hyper Surpime-Cam Subaru Strategic Survey </a> (HSC-SSP) and recently now a new member of the <a href='https://pfs.ipmu.jp/intro.html'>Prime Focus spectrograph </a>  (PFS).Check out these projects if you are interested in deep and wide imaging and spectral surveys.
